**Code**

Here, we provide the code to replicate the baseline Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model and the Interplay Model.
The Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model is used to describe the evolution of the glioma cell density in the brain tissue.
The Interplay Model accounts for the co-evolution of glioma cell density, oxygen concentration in the tissue and density of functional tumour vasculature. 

In the Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model, we vary the diffusion rate, $D_\rho$, and the proliferation rate, $b_\rho$ of glioma cells.
In the Interplay Model, we additionally vary the oxygen consumption rate, $h_2$, and the vaso-occlusion rate, $g_2$.
