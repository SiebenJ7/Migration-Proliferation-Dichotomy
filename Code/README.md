**Code**

Here, we provide the code to replicate the baseline Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model and the Interplay Model.
The Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model is used to describe the evolution of the glioma cell density in the brain tissue.
The Interplay Model accounts for the co-evolution of glioma cell density, oxygen concentration in the tissue and density of functional tumour vasculature. 

We compute the "Baseline Cell Density Model" and the "Interplay Model". We show numerical solutions for the baseline Fisher-Kolmogoroff model for glioma cell density and solutions for the complete model for glioma cell density, oxygen concentration and density of functional vasculature. 

In the Fisher-Kolmogoroff Model, we vary the diffusion rate, $D_\rho$, and the proliferation rate, $b_\rho$ of glioma cells.
In the Interplay Model, we additionally vary the oxygen consumption rate, $h_2$, and the vaso-occlusion rate, $g_2$.
