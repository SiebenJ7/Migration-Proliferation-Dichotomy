Modelling the Migration-Proliferation Dichotomy of glioma cells, following the Alfonso et al. (2016) paper. 

Gliomas form the majority of primary brain tumours and possess a plethora of mechanisms that constitute their malignant potential. One of these mechanisms concerns the ability to adjust their phenotype to the respective environment such that they either proliferate or migrate. 
  The migration-proliferation dichotomy can be modelled in a system of partial differential equations, describing the interplay of glioma cell density, oxygen concentration and the density of functional tumour vasculature. This thesis discusses parts of the Alfonso et al.~model. 
  In addition, we provide a brief overview of the biology of cancer and especially of gliomas to give a basic understanding. Additionally, we embed the model in the theory of PDEs, in particular the theory of reaction-diffusion equations, giving a theoretical overview, analysing the Fisher-Kolmogoroff equation and explaining the origin of reaction-diffusion systems. This thesis finishes by discussing the simulation results of the model and by providing an outlook for subsequent works. This model confirms the migration-dichotomy of glioma cells.
